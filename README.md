## Overview

The TFL Tube Status Tracker is a web application that provides users with an easy-to-use interface to view the status of various tube lines in London. Users can get a high-level overview of the status of all tube lines and view detailed information about a specific line

## Features

- Display a table with an overview of the status of all tube lines.
- Click on a tube line to view more detailed information about that line.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/geraldjtorres/tube-status.git`
2. Install dependencies: `yarb install`
3. Run the development server: `yarn run dev`

## API Integration

To retrieve data from the TFL API, we utilized the following endpoints:

- Get all tube lines: [Line_GetByMode](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/Line/Mode/tube/Status)
- Get tube line status: [Line_StatusByIds](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/swagger/ui/index.html#!/Line/Line_StatusByIds)

The React Query library was used to handle API requests and manage data fetching.

## Usage

1. Upon opening the app, you will be presented with a table displaying the status of all tube lines.
2. Click on a specific line to view more detailed information about its current status.

## Future Improvements

While the initial version of this app fulfills the core requirements, there are several areas where it can be further improved:

- **Responsive Design:** Enhance the app's responsiveness to ensure a seamless experience across various devices.
- **Error Handling:** Implement better error handling to provide users with meaningful feedback in case of API errors.
- **Visual Enhancements:** Add more visual elements and animations to make the app more engaging and user-friendly.
